### Time complexity : O(n) 
"The algorithm runs in linear time $O(N)$ by checking each card once, while using constant space $O(1)$ by saving only the single best option."

### Space complexity : O(1)
"The space complexity is constant $O(1)$ because it uses a fixed set of variables to track the best option, regardless of how many cards are in the hand."

### Used "Greedy Algorithm" because
"We used a greedy algorithm to make the best possible decision for the current turn by minimizing immediate penalties, without the complexity of predicting future moves."
